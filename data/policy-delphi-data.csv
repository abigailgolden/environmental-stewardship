However, such actions should be applied within a framework of broader participation in a particular place and with associated place-based knowledge and care. The urban resident may be facilitating local stewardship by their absence but is not a steward in the proper sense of active care.",Yes,"The virtuous person, i.e., the person whose character is oriented to the common good, should be capable of acting in the best interests of a social-ecological system for which they do not possess feelings of care. In fact, care without virtue is more likely to go astray than virtue without care, because stewardship requires good practice and good practice requires knowledge and skills which are constituents of virtue. ",No,"First, I don't think that Shephard et al. (2023) argue against the care, knowledge and agency. The paper states that ""Angler commitment to sustainable management is embedded in self-interested ownership."" In other words, agency among anglers and other local user groups is imparted more or less according to the Ostrom principles, e.g., boundaries, limited access, ability to sanction cheats etc.

Agency is a high bar, because to be fully realized, it requires knowledge and skills (so you know what to do and how), as well as internal empowerment (virtuous locals who act for the common good) and external empowerment (a supportive legislative framework). Lacking any of these components can impair or prevent good stewardship.

",I don't have enough information to answer this question,"Somewhere in the middle! Stewardship is based on 'sustainable practices'. It often requires wise decisions based on the best available insight and experience. This situation maximizes the likelihood of conservation success but does not preclude failure.

It depends on what ""environmentally conscious"" means. Someone who cares deeply but acts without knowledge or skill may be less likely to succeed than the person who acts from a position of virtue but with more emotional objectivity.",Yes,No,"This depends a bit on your personal or communal anthropology, or perception of human-nonhuman relationships. Some Indigenous stewardship seems to be highly relational or participatory, without even the implicit dualism that is required to 'take responsibility' for aspects of a natural system. In this case, maybe the label is not important or is subsumed into a broader sense of belonging (or something...). In western systems, stewardship may be a little more conscious, even though it may remain deeply embedded. Here, the label may be supportive of stewardship via personal and communal identity.

Identifying as an environmental steward does NOT automatically make a person a steward. Stewardship is primarily about practice, not identity.",Both,"Stewardship is oriented to the common good, i.e., flourishing of humans and biodiversity. Single-species management can lead to actions and outcomes that are harmful to ecosystem health, but this does not constitute stewardship.

The virtuous actor, who is formed within a challenging and mentored outdoor community of practice, e.g., a hunting system, should be able to invoke appropriate social-ecological knowledge and operate at a holistic management scale that transcends their self-interest e.g., catching large fish, and supports higher-level outcomes.",Individuals and groups,"Nice question. 'Society' can be defined as (something like) a group of individuals who collaborate to attain ends that cannot be achieved by the individual. These ends constitute the common good. In this way, and consistent with the idea of subsidiarity, stewardship may operate at the lowest level that will achieve the desired outcome, which may be individual but is highly likely to be a small group. Certain stewardship outcomes may require cooperation at levels up to the nation state or beyond.

At the grassroots, environmental virtue and individual stewardship are likely to emerge through mentored learning in a community of practice. The community introduces both knowledge and skills, as well as normative expectations about appropriate outdoor behavior. This process reveals the importance of the collective. However, virtue (character) is an individual trait, meaning that it is a group of well-formed individuals that act.","um, not really, but I have spent a lot of time eliciting my perspective, and so it is probably unusually stable."

For example, a recreational fisher can decide to not fishing at all during a specific period when a target species may be specifically vulnerable due to, for example, spawning.

Sbragaglia, V., and R. Arlinghaus. 2020. Conservation bottom-up initiatives in marine recreational spearfishing suggest the emergence of positive attitudes towards conservation. Scientia Marina 84:441-444.

We documented that in In 1997 a pioneering Italian spearfisher from Sardinia created the Italian Association of Spearfishing (IAS) with the aim of representing all recreational fishers who were not interested in sports spearfishing and were therefore not members of the national sports fishing association. After five years of activity, the IAS had over 3000 members from 89 different Italian provinces and launched a pioneering project for that time: Sea Sentinels. The main goal of the project was to provide support to research in monitoring fish assemblages, tracking biological invasions and restoring the environment from pollution such as plastic debris. In other words, this association realized the value of citizen science and local ecological knowledge and the problem of plastic marine pollution back in 2002 without any feedback from local or national agencies.

The absence of action could be viewed as simply avoiding harm rather than contributing positively to the health of an ecosystem. 

Furthermore, traditional views of stewardship often emphasise active management and engagement with the environment. This includes activities like habitat restoration, species monitoring, and sustainable resource use. From this perspective, stewardship is inherently active, involving direct intervention to achieve nature conservation goals. 

I think that stewardship is about forming a relationship with the environment, understanding its needs, and working to maintain or enhance its health. This relational aspect could be seen as lacking when the approach is purely non-interactional. 

However, considering arguments for inaction to be a form of stewardship, the care-knowledge-agency framework suggests that stewardship is driven by care for the environment, knowledge of ecological systems, and the agency to act. Having agency over ones actions and decided to refrain from any action can be considered a form of action in itself. If refraining from interaction is based on a deep understanding and care for the environment, recognising that one's interaction could cause harm, it can be argued that this choice embodies the principles of stewardship. However, I think that this viewpoint could more easily fall within the umbrella term of impact avoidance or mitigation rather than environmental stewardship. 

Ultimately, the decision might come down to the specific context and the ecological outcomes of non-interaction. But I think I would lean more towards saying that inaction is not environmental stewardship. ",No,"I tend to think that if a person's pro-environmental actions are not motivated by genuine care for the environment, but rather by self-interest or other motives, that they do not qualify as a steward. As highlighted above, virtue ethics can support this argument as actions motivated purely by self-interest, even if beneficial to the environment, do not reflect the virtuous character required for true stewardship. They might be considered pro-environmental or conservation-orientated action, but I don't think it qualifies as environmental stewardship. 

In saying this, I also see merit in arguing for net benefit to the environment and society, regardless of personal motives. This view leans more towards a utilitarian perspective than deontological or virtue ethics. Given the complexity of human motivations and the diverse interpretations of stewardship, it might be useful to adopt a more inclusive and pragmatic approach that recognises the value of various motivations in achieving conservation goals. 

Ultimately, I think it beneficial to refine the definition of environmental stewardship as it can be extremely broad in its interpretation and when this is the case it can lose a lot of meaning. ",Yes,"I tend to lean towards the stance that stewardship can be seen as a moral stance or a set of values rather than just a set of actions. Members of disempowered communities can still consider themselves stewards if they maintain their knowledge, care for the environment, and a desire to protect it, even if their ability to act is constrained. This perspective aligns with the view that stewardship is partly about maintaining an ethical stance and a commitment to environmental values.

Furthermore, the ethical dimension of stewardship emphasises the intent and ethical orientation of individuals or communities. Even when agency is restricted, the moral responsibility and commitment to stewardship remain intact. This view suggests that stewardship is also about bearing witness to environmental change and advocating for the environment, even in the face of disempowerment.","Anyone who takes an environmentally conscious action is acting as a steward, regardless of the outcome of that action","Stewardship often reflects an individual's or community's commitment to caring for the environment, which is manifested through deliberate actions. This perspective emphasises the importance of the intention behind actions and the ongoing commitment to environmental value. Thus, environmental stewardship can be seen as a process that includes learning and adaptation. From this perspective, engaging in stewardship practices, even if initially ineffective, provides opportunities for learning and improving over time. The iterative nature of stewardship actions can lead to better outcomes in the long term as stewards gain experience and knowledge. 

However, I think the question as it is asked is quite broad. I don't necessarily completely agree with the statement that anyone who take an environmentally conscious action is acting as a steward, regardless of the outcome of that action, as inaction could fall into this category. But if the action is supported through identity and values of environmental care, than yes. . ",Yes,No,"Effective environmental stewardship does not necessarily require explicit self-identification as a steward. Individuals and groups can engage in knowledgeable, environmentally responsible behaviours driven by intrinsic values and concerns, leading to positive environmental outcomes. 

Identifying as an environmental steward does not automatically make a person a steward. While self-identification can enhance motivation and encourage pro-environmental behaviours, true stewardship requires concrete motivation and a moral stance that can result in positive environmental outcomes. Effective stewardship is a dynamic process that integrates moral stance with ongoing learning, critical self-evaluation, and adaptive management to ensure that actions align with environmental goals.",Both,"I think that stewardship can encompass both the management of individual organisms or taxa and entire ecosystems. While species-specific stewardship can have significant positive impacts and engage individuals in nature conservation practices, it must be integrated into a broader ecosystem management framework to ensure holistic and sustainable outcomes. Effective stewardship requires a balance between focused actions and comprehensive ecosystem considerations, supported by adaptive management and learning.",Individuals and groups,"I think that both individuals and organisations can embody environmental stewardship, but the mechanisms through which they operate and the scale at which they can effect change vary. Organisation can still embody the morals and ethics associated with stewardship as a collection of people. Organisations represent the collective wisdom, expertise, and resources of many individuals. This collective capacity can drive more effective and informed stewardship actions. However, care must be taken when considering group or collective environmental stewardship as not all organisations or groups of people inherently align with stewardship values, and individual's views within a collective might not align with other members in the group/organisation. 

Overall, I believe that stewardship can be assigned to both individuals and organisations or groups. Organisations have the capacity to manage resources at scale, leveraging collective knowledge, resources, and authority. However, individual stewards bring personal commitment, flexibility, and localised knowledge to their actions. The most effective environmental stewardship should integrate the strengths of both individual and collective efforts, fostering collaboration and alignment between personal values and institutional goals.","Somewhat, in that this survey highlighted to me just how complex and multifaceted the term stewardship can be. Overall, I think stewardship could benefit from a tighter definition as there other terms that could be used for instances that some might want to associate with stewardship but that might not fit under a tighter definition.

",Only someone whose actions have positive environmental outcomes can be considered to be an environmental steward,"Although I would consider environmental stewardship ultimately as the combination of care and action of positive outcome for the natural environment, I want to highlight that people caring about their natural environment and just taking the 'wrong' actions due to a lack of knowledge have a high potential to become environmental stewards. This potential can be addressed in the management of ecosystems by working together with those people, informing them and empower them to take the 'right' actions that really help the environment.  ",Yes,No,"Yes, someone can be an environmental steward without identifying as one. Maybe they are even the 'better' environmental stewards as they really put the natural environment at first priority by deeply caring about it and don't focus on themselves. It can be linked to the idea of religion. For example, do strictly religious people like Christians show always a high willingness to engage in charity and love of neighbor when they consider themselves as good Christians that have to justify their actions mainly in front of god? Or can non-religious people reach the same willingness to engage in charity and love of neighbor when purely motivated by caring for other people?",Both,"I think that persons can be stewards of both, an entire ecosystem and an individual species naturally occurring in that ecosystem. The necessary condition to be an environmental steward when relating to an individual species is that the taken actions benefiting the focal species at least do not endanger other naturally occurring species in that ecosystem.",Individuals and groups,"Individuals and also groups can act as stewards. However, individuals within groups may lack a key component of stewardship - being the care for the ecosystem - as they may have solely social or economic reasons to engage in the group. Groups may lose their stewardship when actions end in itself and are not based on caring about the system anymore. Therefore, I would relate stewardship more to individuals where the link between care and actions is clear, but to answer the question: Yes, there can be also groups that act as stewards.","The survey definitely broadened my view on the topic. However, I did not come up with a better definition yet. I see a potential to improve it by expressing explicitly what 'valuable' means (e.g. intrinsic value of nature combined with extrinsic value of it for resource users). Furthermore, 'natural species or whole ecosystems' sounds very broad. A person cannot take actions in every ecosystem but only where it is connected to or working at.

So probably like this:
Environmental stewardship is the dedication of humans to protect their natural environment and keep it in a healthy state. It originates from the deep belief that a natural species or entire ecosystem is valuable and manifests itself in actions that maintain this species or system.
